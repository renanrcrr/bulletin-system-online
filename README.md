# SIBOL: Bulletin System Online

:computer: :airplane: :open_file_folder: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
This repository is to show the bulletin system.

The system was developed mainly by First Lieutenant System Analyst Fabio Moreira and First Lieutenant System Analyst Renan C R Rodrigues from Command Brazilian Air Force. 

The aeronautics command often publishes bulletins in the Brazilian official journal with the formal intention to publicly disclose various military actions such as military activities, new positions, contests, holiday changes, entry and departure of commanders, among other issues. Unfortunately, once this publication is created, it is saved and archived in pdf extension files which makes any query more difficult. In this project, a Java application was developed that facilitated the consultation of these bulletins in a database helping all the military.

The tool created was developed through of JSP and Servlet.
